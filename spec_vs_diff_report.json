  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by updating AdminGuard and Navigation components to include an email-based override for finproledge@gmail.com. Both components add ADMIN_EMAILS constant, localStorage email lookup, and combined backend+email admin check. However, the backend (backend/main.mo) is not modified, so the AC requiring the backend to return an admin role for this user's principal is not evidenced in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "The backend returns an admin role (or equivalent authorization) for the principal associated with finproledge@gmail.com.",
      "reason": "No changes to backend/main.mo are present in the diff. The backend isCallerAdmin() function is called but there is no evidence it was updated to recognize finproledge@gmail.com's principal as an admin. The fix relies entirely on frontend email override rather than the backend returning an admin role.",
