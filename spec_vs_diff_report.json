  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2 largely as specified. A DownloadOptionsMenu component and fileExport utilities are added client-side, and the component is integrated into DocumentTable, AdminClientDeliverableTable, and ComplianceAdminToDoList. The '99.8% filling accuracy' and 'client support 24/7' stats are removed from HomePage. The AdminGuard protection for the download menu is implicit via the parent admin page guard, consistent with the single-actor architecture constraint. The Document format is implemented as RTF-in-HTML rather than true DOCX binary but is present as a selectable option.",
