  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features across backend and frontend. REQ-1 through REQ-6 and REQ-8 appear well-covered. REQ-7 (admin forms must all have 'Assign to Client' field) is partially unclear from the diff — the existing admin forms are not shown as modified. The backend main.mo is modified (truncated) and migration.mo is added. Frontend hooks, client forms, ClientTasksTab, and ComplianceDashboardPage are all updated. However, evidence for REQ-7's requirement that ALL four admin create forms consistently have the clientPrincipal assignment field is absent from the diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "All four admin create forms (CreateToDoForm, CreateTimelineForm, CreateFollowUpForm, CreateDeadlineForm) must have an optional 'Assign to Client (Principal)' input field so admins can assign items to clients.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no modifications to the existing admin-facing create form components (CreateToDoForm, CreateTimelineForm, CreateFollowUpForm, CreateDeadlineForm). There is no evidence that CreateTimelineForm and CreateDeadlineForm were updated to include the clientPrincipal assignment field, which the requirement states must be consistent across all four forms.",
