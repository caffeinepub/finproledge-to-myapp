  "summary": "The diff shows only two files modified: backend/main.mo (with truncated content showing type definitions but no functional changes related to the requirements) and project_state.json (which only records the requirements as 'pending' feature requests). None of REQ-1, REQ-2, or REQ-3 have been actually implemented — no frontend files were modified, no approval data mapping was fixed, no file upload pipeline was corrected, and no filter bar was added.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Audit and fix approvals data mapping in the frontend Admin Dashboard: ensure all fields of each approval object are correctly destructured and rendered, remove truncation logic, and keep the list in sync after mutations.",
      "reason": "No frontend files were modified in the diff. The approvals tab UI, data mapping, and truncation logic remain untouched. project_state.json lists this as 'pending'.",
