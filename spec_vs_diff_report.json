  "summary": "The diff shows partial implementation of the three requirements. ClientTasksTab.tsx imports status select components (ToDoStatusSelect, TimelineStatusSelect, FollowUpStatusSelect, DeadlineStatusSelect) from TaskStatusSelect, satisfying part of REQ-2. However, the file is truncated so full usage in table rows cannot be confirmed. There is no evidence of MyComplianceTasksSection changes (REQ-1), no backend update-status endpoint additions visible in the truncated main.mo (REQ-3 backend), and no frontend mutation hooks for status updates (REQ-3 frontend). The project_state.json still marks all AR items as 'pending', suggesting the implementation may be incomplete.",
