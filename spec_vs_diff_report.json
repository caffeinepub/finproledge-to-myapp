  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 and REQ-2 in the frontend (AdminGuard and Navigation components) by adding email-based admin override logic for finproledge@gmail.com with localStorage fallback and lowercase normalization. REQ-3 (backend fix) is not clearly implemented — the backend/main.mo diff is truncated and shows no explicit hardcoded principal or email-to-admin mapping for finproledge@gmail.com, and the MixinAuthorization import is unchanged with no visible isCallerAdmin fix targeting that principal.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Audit and fix the backend role-check logic so that the principal associated with finproledge@gmail.com is recognised as an admin by the isAdmin (or equivalent) backend function.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and shows only type definitions and imports with no visible change to isCallerAdmin, isAdmin, or any admin-principals list that would add the principal linked to finproledge@gmail.com. No evidence of a backend fix for this specific principal is present in the diff.",
