Remove any truncation logic that silently hides records or fields. Ensure the UI displays a complete, untruncated list of all approval entries with all their detail fields visible.",

On the admin download side, audit the reconstruction logic in `DocumentTable.tsx`, `ComplianceAdminToDoList.tsx`, and any download utility so that the original MIME type and byte sequence are preserved.
