# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reorganize the navigation hierarchy by nesting "Compliance" under the Client Portal section and "Compliance Admin" under the Admin menu, removing both as top-level nav items.

**Planned changes:**
- Move the "Compliance" link from a top-level nav item to a nested item within the "Client Portal" section (desktop and mobile menus), preserving visibility rules for authenticated and approved users.
- Move the "Compliance Admin" link from a top-level nav item to a nested item within the "Admin" menu section (desktop and mobile menus), preserving admin-only visibility.

**User-visible outcome:** Users will find "Compliance" grouped under the Client Portal section and "Compliance Admin" grouped under the Admin menu, resulting in a cleaner, more organized navigation structure.
