The download button should present a dropdown with these format options. For formats that require conversion (e.g., exporting a list as CSV or ZIP), generate the file client-side from available data. For file blobs already stored (e.g., uploaded documents and deliverables), provide direct download with the selected format extension. ZIP downloads should bundle multiple selected files into a single archive.",
